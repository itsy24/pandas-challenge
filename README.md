## Project : School Data

### Program : Python - Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

Overview: District schools, which have more students and a higher budget underperformed compared to charter schools, which had less students and a smaller budget. This suggests that a smaller student:teacher ratio is more beneificial for student learning outcome; however, as mentioned above the data below showcases only two subjects and a handful of schools -- more data needs to be gathered to form a more definitive conclusion.

Jupyter notebook and python with pandas imported was used to analyze the school and student records stored in a comma-separated values (.csv) files for different quantitative indexes. A summary table is displayed within the notebook as well as the same analysis written below: 


The data from 15 unique schools shows that of the 39,170 students 65% passed both math and reading, with reading scores being about 10% higher than math scores.


Separating the schools by school type (Charter or District) shows charter schools had a higher percent overall passing compared to district schools; however, this is just for math and reading, more data would be needed to determine if this trend continues across all subjects.


The 15 schools had an overall total budget of $24,649,428; however, spending more money per student does not mean higher passing scores for math and reading (passing rate = 53%). In fact, schools that spent the least money per student had a 90% pass rate for both subjects.


Larger schools (2000-5000 students enrolled) had lower scores for both subjects compared to small (<1000 students enrolled) and medium (1000-2000 students enrolled) sized schools.
